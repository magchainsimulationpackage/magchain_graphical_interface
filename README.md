# Description
1) **MagChainSetup:** Graphical interface to run MagChain simulations. As it is explained in the MagChain Simultion Program documentation, an attraction_radius.dat file and a general input file (that includes the attraction_radius.dat file) are needed. With this graphical interface these input files can be easily generated and, afterwards, the simulation can be run.

2) **MagChainAnalysis:** Graphical interface to analyse the generated output data by MagChain Simulation Program.

# Requirements
  
Python 3 installed with the following libraries

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyQt5

# Usage

Open the .pyw file by double cliking or execute from a console as `python3 filename.pyw`
